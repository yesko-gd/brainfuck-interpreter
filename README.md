# Description
This is a run-time interpreter for the esoteric programming language Brainfuck, written in C.

To run it, pass the script to be interpreted as the first command-line argument.

# Build
The interpreter works on Linux and Windows, you should just be able to run the file "build.bat"/"build.sh". The files assume that GCC is installed as the command "gcc", if it isn't, you're going to have to adjust the build command...
I haven't tested building on Windows, only running the executable.
(A proper build system would probably be a good idea...)
